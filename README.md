## TEST_1

1.Suppose a child psychologist says that the average time that working mothers spend talking to their children is at-least 11 minutes per day. You want to test
You conduct a random sample of 1000 working mothers and find they spend an average of 11.5 minutes per day talking with their children. Assume prior research suggests the population standard deviation is 2.3 minutes.
Conduct test with a level of significance of alpha=0.05 ?


## Answer:
Hypothesis Test for the Average Time Working Mothers Spend Talking to Their Children:
Null Hypothesis (H0): μ ≥ 11 minutes (The average time mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day).
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): μ < 11 minutes (The average time mothers spend talking to their children is less than 11 minutes per day).

Given:
Sample Mean (x̄) = 11.5 minutes
Population Standard Deviation (σ) = 2.3 minutes
Sample Size (n) = 1000
Level of Significance (α) = 0.05 (critical value = -1.645 for a left-tailed test)

Calculation:
Standard Error (SE) = σ / √n = 2.3 / √1000 ≈ 0.0726

Test Statistic (z) = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (11.5 - 11) / 0.0726 ≈ 6.87

Now, compare the test statistic to the critical value:
z < -1.645

Since the test statistic (6.87) is greater than the critical value (-1.645) and falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is enough evidence to conclude that, at a significance level of 0.05, the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is less than 11 minutes per day.

# TEST_2

2.A coffee shop claims that their average wait time for customers is less than 5 minutes. To test this claim, a sample of 40 customers is taken, and their wait times are recorded. The sample mean wait time is found to be 4.6 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.8 minutes. Perform a hypothesis test at a significance level of 0.05 and determine whether there is enough evidence to support the coffee shop's claim.
Perform the hypothesis testing using correct test statistics and appropriate critical value

## Answer


Hypothesis Test for the Average Time Working Mothers Spend Talking to Their Children:
Null Hypothesis (H0): μ ≥ 11 minutes (The average time mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day).
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): μ < 11 minutes (The average time mothers spend talking to their children is less than 11 minutes per day).

Given:
Sample Mean (x̄) = 11.5 minutes
Population Standard Deviation (σ) = 2.3 minutes
Sample Size (n) = 1000
Level of Significance (α) = 0.05 (critical value = -1.645 for a left-tailed test)

Calculation:
Standard Error (SE) = σ / √n = 2.3 / √1000 ≈ 0.0726

Test Statistic (z) = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (11.5 - 11) / 0.0726 ≈ 6.87

Now, compare the test statistic to the critical value:
z < -1.645

Since the test statistic (6.87) is greater than the critical value (-1.645) and falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is enough evidence to conclude that, at a significance level of 0.05, the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is less than 11 minutes per day.

Hypothesis Test for Coffee Shop's Claim:
Null Hypothesis (H0): μ ≥ 5 minutes (The average wait time for customers is 5 minutes or more).
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): μ < 5 minutes (The average wait time for customers is less than 5 minutes).

Given:
Sample Mean (x̄) = 4.6 minutes
Sample Standard Deviation (s) = 0.8 minutes
Sample Size (n) = 40
Level of Significance (α) = 0.05 (critical value = -1.645 for a left-tailed test)

Calculation:
Standard Error (SE) = s / √n = 0.8 / √40 ≈ 0.1265

Test Statistic (z) = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (4.6 - 5) / 0.1265 ≈ -3.969

Now, compare the test statistic to the critical value:
z < -1.645

Since the test statistic (-3.969) is less than the critical value (-1.645) and falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is enough evidence to conclude that, at a significance level of 0.05, the average wait time for customers at the coffee shop is less than 5 minutes, supporting the coffee shop's claim.
